# Variables
# steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
# date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
# interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

# assignment:
# Ultimately, you will need to complete the entire assignment in a single R 
# markdown document that can be processed by knitr and 
# be transformed into an HTML file.
# echo = TRUE

# OBS!!!! Change to this library instead!!!

# 1
# NOTE: The GitHub repository also contains the dataset 
# for the assignment so you do not have to download the data separately.
# Loading and preprocessing the data
# Show any code that is needed to
# Load the data (i.e. read.csv())
# Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis
# 


#  2/What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
# For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.
# Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
# If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, 
# research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the 
# total number of steps taken each day
# Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day



# 3/ What is the average daily activity pattern?
# 
# Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) 
# and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
# 
# Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, 
# contains the maximum number of steps?

# 4/ Imputing missing values
# 
# Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values 
# (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into 
# some calculations or summaries of the data.
# 
# Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset 
# (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
# 
# Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
# The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, 
# you could use the mean/median for that day, 
# or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
# 
# Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset 
# but with the missing data filled in.
# 
# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day 
# and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of 
# steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates 
# from the first part of the assignment? 
# What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates 
# of the total daily number of steps?
# 
# 


# 5 Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
# 
# For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. 
# Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.
# 
# Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – 
# “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
# 
# Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") 
# of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, 
# averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 
# See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example 
# of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
